
I implemented two user interfaces, one parse the content of the array from 
the input file, and the other allows user to specify the size of the array, if
the file is not found as a command line argument, the program will automatically 
changes to the interface that allows user to specify the array size.

The interface that allow user to type the size as input, will keep asking user 
for input after a sorting algorithm is performed. Additionally, type "CI" if you 
would like to change the content of the array, otherwise the program will keep 
using the array that was originally generated, this allow the user to compare 
the number of comparisons made by different algorithms on the same input array. 
The size of the array can be changed as well, type "CS" to change the input 
size once the size of the array is changed, both the size and the content of the 
array will be regenerated.
